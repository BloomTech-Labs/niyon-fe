## Project Overview

[Trello Board](https://trello.com/b/35RQNtt9/labspt10-niyon)

[Product Canvas](https://www.notion.so/ffa6c91910394e0cad11cf6c51219336?v=d32644f1e5734ecb943d2bad435c17ec)

Niyon is an online platform that aims to connect young coders with mentors. Starting a job in a new location or new industry is extremely difficult. Niyon helps young professionals increase their confidence skills, meet colleagues in a new location and find support to help them develop the skills needed for their coding career. Niyon will be launching a pilot of its mentorship platform in West Africa and aims to reduce the unemployment rate in those countries.


### Key Features

-    Give the ability for inexperienced professionals who seek tech mentorship in West Africa to be connected with a mentor of their choosing via different filtering fields
-    Give mentors and mentees the ability to text/video chat in real time
-    Give mentees a place to ask questions by way of a forum
-    Site contains a newsfeed that displays relevant tech/career articles
-    Site has a map to visualize users around them for potential meetups

# APIs

## 3️⃣ Misc API here

🚫Replace text below with a description of the API

You can do anything your heart can imagine. In life you need colors. This is where you take out all your hostilities and frustrations. It's better than kicking the puppy dog around and all that so. I'm sort of a softy, I couldn't shoot Bambi except with a camera. Trees get lonely too, so we'll give him a little friend. We'll lay all these little funky little things in there.

## 3️⃣ Misc API here

🚫Replace text below with a description of the API

When you do it your way you can go anywhere you choose. Let your heart take you to wherever you want to be. If I paint something, I don't want to have to explain what it is. A tree needs to be your friend if you're going to paint him. That's a son of a gun of a cloud. Even the worst thing we can do here is good.

## 3️⃣ Misc API here

🚫Replace text below with a description of the API

Volunteering your time; it pays you and your whole community fantastic dividends. Maybe there's a happy little waterfall happening over here. You can spend all day playing with mountains. We don't have to be committed. We are just playing here. You have freedom here. The only guide is your heart. It's cold, but it's beautiful.

# 3️⃣ Environment Variables

In order for the app to function correctly, the user must set up their own environment variables. There should be a .env file containing the following:

🚫These are just examples, replace them with the specifics for your app

    *  REACT_APP_apiKey - this is your Google API key, which can be generated in the Google Cloud Console
    *  REACT_APP_authDomain - when you set up your Firebase project, this information will be in the dashboard
    *  REACT_APP_databaseURL - in the Firebase dashboard
    *  REACT_APP_projectID - in the Firebase dashboard
    *  REACT_APP_storageBucket - in the Firebase dashboard
    *  REACT_APP_messagingSenderId - in the Firebase dashboard
    *  REACT_APP_stripe_API - this is your public Stripe API key, generated in the Stripe dashboard
    *  REACT_APP_backendURL - optional for your local development server
    *  REACT_APP_clientid - this is the Stripe_connect clientID, generated in Stripe_connect settings
    *  REACT_APP_stripe_plan - this is the ID for a second Stripe subscription plan, generated under Stripe products


# 4️⃣ Testing
